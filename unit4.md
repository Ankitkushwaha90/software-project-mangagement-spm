# ðŸ“˜ Project Management and Control

Project management and control ensures that the project is progressing as plannedâ€”on time, within budget, and according to quality expectations. It helps detect issues early and correct course efficiently.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Framework for Management and Control

A structured system that:

- Defines what to manage (scope, cost, time, quality)
- Decides how to manage (techniques/tools)
- Implements controls to monitor and guide the project

**Key Components:**

- **Baseline:** Reference plan for scope, schedule, cost  
- **Monitoring system:** Gathers data on current performance  
- **Control system:** Compares actual vs. planned, applies corrective actions  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Collection of Data

Continuous tracking of project status by collecting:

- Task progress (e.g., 40% completed)  
- Time spent  
- Resources used  
- Actual cost vs. planned cost  
- Quality measures  

**Methods:**

- Timesheets  
- Daily status reports  
- Automated software (e.g., Jira, Trello, MS Project)  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Visualizing Progress

Making data easy to understand through visual tools.

**Common Tools:**

- **Gantt Charts:** Task duration, dependencies, deadlines  
- **Bar Charts:** Progress comparison  
- **Milestone Charts:** Key project points  
- **S-Curves:** Cumulative cost or effort over time  
- **Burn-down Charts (Agile):** Work remaining over time  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Cost Monitoring

Tracking project expenses to stay within budget.

**Key Techniques:**

- **Planned Value (PV):** Expected cost of planned work  
- **Actual Cost (AC):** Real cost incurred  
- **Cost Variance (CV):** CV = EV - AC  

**Tools:** MS Excel, MS Project, Primavera, ERP systems  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Earned Value Analysis (EVA)

A powerful method to monitor both cost and schedule.

**Key Terms:**

- **EV (Earned Value):** Value of work actually completed  
- **PV (Planned Value):** Budgeted cost of scheduled work  
- **AC (Actual Cost):** Cost incurred for work done  

**Key Formulas:**

- Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC  
- Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV  
- Estimate at Completion (EAC) = BAC / CPI  

**Variance Analysis:**

- CV = EV - AC (cost overrun or underrun)  
- SV = EV - PV (behind or ahead of schedule)  

âœ… Helps predict future performance based on current trends.

## ðŸ“Œ 6. Prioritizing Monitoring

You cannot track everything equally. Focus on:

- High-risk tasks  
- Critical path activities  
- Cost-intensive tasks  
- Customer-priority features  
- Tasks with a history of delay or rework  

**Monitoring Techniques:**

- Status meetings  
- Daily scrums (Agile)  
- Milestone reviews  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 7. Project Tracking

Tracking ensures alignment with goals and facilitates early correction.

**Key Aspects:**

- Compare actual vs. baseline (cost, time, scope)  
- Identify deviations  
- Conduct status reviews  
- Update project dashboard  

**Tools:** Microsoft Project, Asana, Jira, Trello, Zoho Projects  

---

## ðŸ“Œ 8. Change Control

Formal process to manage changes in scope, schedule, or cost.

**Steps:**

1. Change Request Submission (by team/client/stakeholders)  
2. Impact Analysis (on scope, cost, and schedule)  
3. Change Review Board Approval  
4. Implementation of change  
5. Documentation and baseline update  

**Key Principle:**  
"Control changes without disturbing the project baseline."

âœ… Prevents scope creep, delays, and budget overflow.

| Data Collection      | Captures real-time project progress             |
| Visualizing Progress | Graphical tools (Gantt, S-curve, burndown)      |
| Cost Monitoring      | Tracks actual vs. planned expenditure            |
| Earned Value Analysis| Combines scope, time, and cost performance       |
| Monitoring Prioritization | Focus on high-risk or critical tasks           |
| Project Tracking     | Regular status checking and course correction     |
| Change Control       | Structured process to handle change requests      |

## âœ… Real-Life Example (Mini Scenario):

Letâ€™s say you're managing a software project with a 3-month deadline. After 1 month:

- Planned progress = 50%  
- Actual progress = 40%  
- Budget spent = 70%  

You apply EVA:

- EV = 40%  
- PV = 50%  
- AC = 70%  

â†’ SV = EV - PV = -10% (delayed)  
â†’ CV = EV - AC = -30% (over budget)  

â†’ Corrective actions: reduce scope, speed up tasks, add resources.

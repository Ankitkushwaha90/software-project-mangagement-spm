# ðŸ“Œ Software Project Management (SPM)

## 1. Importance of Software Project Management

Software Project Management ensures that software projects are delivered:

- **On Time** (Scheduling)  
- **Within Budget** (Cost Management)  
- **With Desired Quality** (Quality Assurance)  
- **As per Requirements** (Scope Management)  

**Key Reasons:**
- Software is intangible â€“ hard to measure progress.  
- Development is complex and may change mid-project.  
- Projects may involve large teams in different locations.  
- Clients may change requirements often.

## 2. Activities of Software Project Management

| Activity     | Description                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Planning** | Define scope, resources, timeline, risks, deliverables. |
| **Scheduling** | Create work breakdown structure, Gantt charts, timelines. |
| **Estimating** | Cost, time, and effort estimation.                 |
| **Monitoring** | Track progress and update plans.                   |
| **Controlling** | Handle deviations and risks.                    |
| **Reporting** | Communicate with stakeholders.                     |

## 3. Methodologies in Software Project Management

| Methodology | Description                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Waterfall** | Sequential, linear process.               |
| **Agile** | Iterative, adaptive, customer-focused.     |
| **Scrum** | Agile framework with roles, sprints, reviews. |
| **Spiral** | Risk-driven model, iterative.              |
| **DevOps** | Continuous integration and delivery.       |

## 4. Categorization of Software Projects

Software projects can be categorized based on:

- **Size**: Small, Medium, Large.  
- **Complexity**: Simple UI vs. AI/ML-based systems.  
- **Domain**: Web, Mobile, Embedded, Enterprise, etc.  
- **Risk Level**: Low to high risk.  
- **Team Size**: Solo dev to large enterprise teams.

## 5. Setting Objectives

Effective project objectives should be **SMART**:

- **S**pecific: Clear and precise.  
- **M**easurable: Quantifiable results.  
- **A**chievable: Realistic with available resources.  
- **R**elevant: Aligned with business goals.  
- **T**ime-bound: Fixed deadlines.

## 6. Management Principles in Software Projects

- **Division of Work**: Specialized roles improve efficiency.  
- **Authority & Responsibility**: Balanced power and accountability.  
- **Discipline**: Following rules and standards.  
- **Unity of Command**: One manager per task.  
- **Unity of Direction**: One objective, one plan.  
- **Order**: Systematic arrangement of people and resources.  
- **Equity**: Fair treatment for all team members.  
- **Stability**: Low staff turnover.

## 7. Management Control

Involves:

- **Progress Monitoring**: Are tasks on track?  
- **Quality Control**: Are deliverables acceptable?  
- **Budget Control**: Are we overspending?  
- **Change Control**: Handling modifications to scope or timeline.  
- **Milestone Reviews**: Periodic evaluation checkpoints.  

---

## 8. Project Portfolio Management (PPM)

Managing multiple projects simultaneously for:

- Resource optimization  
- Risk balancing  
- Strategic alignment  

**Components:**
- **Portfolio Selection**: Choose projects that align with company goals.  
- **Prioritization**: Rank projects by ROI, risk, impact.  
- **Monitoring**: Track progress of all projects.  

---

## 9. Cost-Benefit Evaluation Technology

Used to justify project investment.

**Techniques:**

- **Payback Period**: Time to recover initial investment.  
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: `(Gain â€“ Cost) / Cost`  
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Future profits in todayâ€™s value.  
- **Cost-Benefit Ratio**: `Total Benefits / Total Costs`  

---

## 10. Risk Evaluation in Projects

**Types of Risks:**
- **Technical Risks**: New technologies, integration issues.  
- **Resource Risks**: Lack of skilled people.  
- **Schedule Risks**: Unrealistic timelines.  
- **Financial Risks**: Budget overruns.  
- **External Risks**: Legal, political, market changes.  

**Risk Management Steps:**

1. Risk Identification  
2. Risk Analysis  
3. Risk Prioritization  
4. Risk Mitigation Planning  
5. Monitoring and Control

## 11. Strategic Program Management

**Program** = A group of related projects with a common goal.

- Focuses on long-term strategic objectives.  
- Provides governance across projects for alignment with business goals.  

**Includes:**

- Benefit realization  
- Stakeholder engagement  
- Organizational change management

## 12. Stepwise Project Planning (7-Step Model)

A structured approach by software management experts like Ian Sommerville.

**Steps:**

1. **Project Scope and Objectives**  
   - Define problem, boundaries, and goals.  
2. **Project Infrastructure**  
   - Decide organization structure, tools, and processes.  
3. **Project Product Breakdown**  
   - Identify modules and major components.  
4. **Project Activities and Dependencies**  
   - Break into tasks and show dependencies.  
5. **Estimate Effort for Activities**  
   - Time and resources needed.  
6. **Allocate Resources**  
   - Assign team members, tools, and time.  
7. **Schedule and Milestones**  
   - Create Gantt/PERT charts, define milestones.

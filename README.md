# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 1. Problem Identification & Requirement Analysis
- Understand the problem to be solved.
- Gather user and business requirements.
- Identify constraints (budget, technology, deadline).

## 2. Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
### Purpose
Defines the functional and non-functional requirements.

### Components of SRS
- **Introduction** (Objective, Scope)
- **Functional Requirements**
- **Non-functional Requirements** (Security, Performance, UI)
- **User Interfaces & Constraints**

#### Example
For an e-commerce app, SRS should include features like:
- User Authentication
- Product Search
- Payment Integration

## 3. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
### Purpose
Visualizes data movement within the system.

### Levels
- **DFD Level 0**: High-level process flow.
- **DFD Level 1**: Breaks down into subsystems.
- **DFD Level 2+**: Detailed process breakdown.

#### Example
In an e-commerce system, a DFD might show:
- "User Login" → "User Authentication" → "Dashboard"

## 4. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
### Purpose
Represents the database structure.

### Components
- **Entities** (Users, Products, Orders)
- **Relationships** (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
- **Attributes** (Primary Keys, Foreign Keys)

#### Example
A shopping cart system ERD showing relationships between:
- Users
- Orders
- Products

## 5. Collaboration Diagram (for System Communication)
### Purpose
Shows interactions between objects.

### Components
- **Objects** (User, System, Database)
- **Messages** (Actions performed)
- **Associations** (Links between components)

#### Example
When a user purchases a product, the collaboration diagram shows interactions:
- "User" → "Payment Gateway" → "Order Processing"

## 6. Designing the System
- UI/UX Wireframes and Prototypes.
- Database Schema Design.
- API Design (if required).

## 7. Development (Coding Phase)
- Choose a Tech Stack (Python, Java, Node.js, etc.).
- Implement functionality in modules.
- Follow coding best practices (Clean Code, Security Measures).

## 8. Testing (Debugging & Validation)
- **Unit Testing**: Testing small components.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing module interactions.
- **System Testing**: Ensuring software works as a whole.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**.

## 9. Deployment & Maintenance
- Deploy on a server (AWS, Azure, or Self-hosted).
- Monitor logs and fix issues.
- Provide updates and security patches.
